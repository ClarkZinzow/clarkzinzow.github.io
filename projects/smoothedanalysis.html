			<h2>Spectral Theory of Operators Research</h2>
			<h4 class="margin">Mathematics Research</h4>
			<p> A linear operator, simply put, is a linear map from one vector space to another.  The properties and classification of single operators, as well as the spaces consisting of said operators, are of signficant interest and are frequently used in linear algebra and functional analysis, with applications in probability theory, geometry, calculus, and many areas of applied math, especially mathematical physics.  For more general information on operators, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim" target="_blank">here's the wikipedia article.</a>
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>My specific area of interest is in the spectral theory of operators, which attempts to extend the eigenvector and eigenvalue theory of square matrices to an analogous spectral theory of linear operators.  The goal of this theory is the same as the general goal of operator theory: try to "classify" all linear operators in useful ways.  Particular attention is paid to operators on Hilbert spaces.  This leads to useful applications to other areas of mathematics by, for example, modeling an operator on Hilbert spaces with an operator on some other selection of spaces, with the latter operator/spaces pair being the special case that we are interested in exploring (sourced from physics, perhaps.)  This is useful because an explicit classification of operators on Hilbert spaces, in terms of simple models, can give us new tools for (among other things) solving linear equations between Banach spaces (or Hilbert spaces), which we frequently need to do.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Why the restriction to Hilbert spaces, you ask?  First, because Hilbert spaces are much easier (we're still working on the general theory for Banach spaces, but it's much more difficult.)  Second, many of the most important applications to other areas of mathematics coincide with this restriction to Hilbert spaces.  This is because Hilbert spaces generalize the notion of Euclidean space as follows.  A Hilbert space possesses an inner product and is complete; the former gives you the notions of angle and distance, the latter tells you that ther are "no points missing" (i.e. the space is complete in the sense that we can "fill all of the holes" with some number contained in the space.)  These properties allow an extension of vector algebra and calculus to be made from two- and three-dimensional Euclidean space to a Hilbert space of any finite or even infinite dimension.  Hence Hilbert spaces allow generalizations of concepts like projections and change of basis from the usual finite dimensional setting, with a specific example of this being the spectral theory of bounded self-adjoint linear operators on Hilbert spaces generalizing the eigendecomposition of a matrix via the spectral decomposition of the operator.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Given that Euclidean geometry seems to correctly describe the geometry of our universe at many scales, when attempting to extend finite-dimensional arguments about operators to an infinite-dimensional space, it makes sense to keep the arguments as close as possible to the familiar Euclidean geometric intuition.  Hence using the more general and potentially infinite-dimensional analogue of Euclidean geometry, Hilbert spaces, will tend to yield useful generalizations and extensions of familiar Euclidean geometric arguments.  The fact that the spectral theory of linear operators on Hilbert spaces is incredibly useful due to it being a generalization of the eigenvector and eigenvalue theory of a square matrix in Euclidean space is an example of this.

			<p>Given a linear operator $T$ acting on a Banach space $X$ over the scalar field $\mathbb{K}$, the spectrum of $T$ is the set of all $\gamma \in \mathbb{K}$ such that $\gamma I - T$ is not invertible.</p>
