			<h2>Flexy</h2>
			<h4 class="margin">App</h4>
			<p>Flexy is a fitness-oriented social network with a native smartphone meet-up app.  Flexy is built around avid fitness enthusiasts and regular gym-goers alike, emphasizing and facilitating connections between those with similar fitness interests.  These connections can be on a strictly social level, or they can even help people find workout buddies, from yoga partners, to weight lifting spotters, to teammates for a pickup basketball, soccer, volleyball, or football team, to training partners for a future race/competition, essentially giving you a fitness friend for any of your favorite workouts.  This creates a social support structure around those that might want or need motivation to stay active.  The iOS, Android, and Windows phone meetup app provides a way to easily connect with your fitness friends, or â€œFlexers", when you wish to meet up with them for a workout.</p>
