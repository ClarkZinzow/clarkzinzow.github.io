			<h2>Spectral Theory of Operators Research</h2>
			<h4 class="margin">Mathematics Research</h4>
			<p> A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(mathematics)#Linear_operators" target="_blank">linear operator</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, simply put, is a linear map from one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space" target="_blank">vector space</a> to another.  The properties and classification of single operators, as well as the spaces consisting of said operators, are of signficant interest and are frequently used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra" target="_blank">linear algebra</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_analysis" target="_blank">functional analysis</a>, with applications in a multitude of pure mathematical subfields as well as applied mathematics.  Iterest and utility for the latter especially holds true for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics" target="_blank">mathematical physics</a>.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>My specific area of interest is in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_theory">spectral theory of linear operators</a>, which attempts to extend the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors" target="_blank">eigenvector and eigenvalue theory of square matrices</a> to an analogous spectral theory of linear operators.  The goal of this theory is the same as the general goal of operator theory: try to "classify" all linear operators in useful ways.  Particular attention is paid to operators on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space" target="_blank">Hilbert spaces</a>.  This leads to useful applications to other areas of mathematics by, for example, modeling an operator on Hilbert spaces with an operator on some other domain and codomain, with the latter operator/spaces pair being the specific case that we are interested in exploring (sourced from physics, perhaps.)  This equivalence of the operator on Hilbert spaces with an operator on some other spaces allows us to use results from the former to say things about the latter.  This is useful because an explicit classification of operators on Hilbert spaces, in terms of simple models, can give us new tools for (among other things) solving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_linear_equations#Solving_a_linear_system" target="_blank">linear equations</a> between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_space" target="_blank">Banach spaces</a> (or Hilbert spaces), which we frequently need to do.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Why the restriction to Hilbert spaces, you ask?  First, because Hilbert spaces are much easier (we're still working on the general theory for Banach spaces, but it's much more difficult.)  Second, many of the most important applications to other areas of mathematics coincide with this restriction to Hilbert spaces.  This is because Hilbert spaces generalize the notion of Euclidean space as follows.  A Hilbert space possesses an inner product and is complete; the former gives you the notions of angle and distance, the latter tells you that ther are "no points missing" (i.e. the space is complete in the sense that we can "fill all of the holes" with some number contained in the space.)  These properties allow an extension of vector algebra and calculus to be made from two- and three-dimensional Euclidean space to a Hilbert space of any finite or even infinite dimension.  Hence Hilbert spaces allow generalizations of concepts like projections and change of basis from the usual finite dimensional setting, with a specific example of this being the spectral theory of bounded self-adjoint linear operators on Hilbert spaces generalizing the eigendecomposition of a matrix via the spectral decomposition of the operator.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Given that Euclidean geometry seems to correctly describe the geometry of our universe at many scales, when attempting to extend finite-dimensional arguments about operators to an infinite-dimensional space, it makes sense to keep the arguments as close as possible to the familiar Euclidean geometric intuition.  Hence using the more general and potentially infinite-dimensional analogue of Euclidean geometry, Hilbert spaces, will tend to yield useful generalizations and extensions of familiar Euclidean geometric arguments.  The fact that the spectral theory of linear operators on Hilbert spaces is incredibly useful due to it being a generalization of the eigenvector and eigenvalue theory of a square matrix in Euclidean space is an example of this.

			<p>Given a linear operator $T$ acting on a Banach space $X$ over the scalar field $\mathbb{K}$, the spectrum of $T$ is the set of all $\gamma \in \mathbb{K}$ such that $\gamma I - T$ is not invertible.</p>

			Professor Kiselev, formerly at UW-Madison and now at Rice University, has written up a great overview of an area of research that I am very interested in, namely the spectral theory of Schr\:odinger operators, and posed a couple of extremely interesting open problems at the end.</p>
