			<h2>Spectral Theory of Operators Research</h2>
			<h4 class="margin">Mathematics Research</h4>
			<p> A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(mathematics)#Linear_operators" target="_blank">linear operator</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, simply put, is a linear map from one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space" target="_blank">vector space</a> to another.  The properties and classification of single operators, as well as the spaces consisting of said operators, are of signficant interest and are frequently used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra" target="_blank">linear algebra</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_analysis" target="_blank">functional analysis</a>, with wide-ranging applications in a multitude of pure mathematical subfields, as well as applied mathematics.  Interest in and the utility of the latter is very apparent in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics" target="_blank">mathematical physics</a>.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>My specific area of interest is in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_theory">spectral theory of linear operators</a>, which attempts to extend the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors" target="_blank">eigenvector and eigenvalue theory of square matrices</a> to an analogous spectral theory of linear operators.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>  The goal of this theory is the same as the general goal of operator theory: try to "classify" all linear operators in useful ways.  Particular attention is paid to operators on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space" target="_blank">Hilbert spaces</a>.  This leads to useful applications to other areas of mathematics by, for example, modeling an operator on Hilbert spaces with an operator on some other domain and codomain, with the latter operator/spaces pair being the specific case that we are interested in exploring.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>  This equivalence of the operator on Hilbert spaces with an operator on some other spaces allows us to use general results from the former to say significant things about the latter.  This explicit classification of operators on Hilbert spaces, in terms of simple models, can give us new tools for (among other things) solving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_linear_equations#Solving_a_linear_system" target="_blank">linear equations</a> between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_space" target="_blank">Banach spaces</a> (or, more likely, Hilbert spaces), which we frequently need to do.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Why the restriction to Hilbert spaces, you ask?  Ultimately, there is a single important justification for the restriction to Hilbert spaces, but we can split it into two significant reasons that are linked by an underlying structure:</p>
			<ul class="project-list">
				<li><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Hilbert spaces are much easier to work with when it comes to spectral theory and, well, most functional analysis things in comparison to Banach spaces.</span><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>  One aspect of it being "easier" is strictly in the formal sense; mathematically, we find that the extension of analytical methods developed for familiar spaces, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space" target="_blank">Euclidean space</a>, tends to be easy relative to abstracting these methods to Banach spaces.  The other aspect of "easier", namely our ability to effectively apply our existing algebraic, geometric, and calculus intuition to Hilbert spaces, is explained in the next item, along with a very general explanation of how this intuition and easy extension from Euclidean space to Hilbert space go hand-in-hand.</li>
				<li><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Many of the most important applications to other areas of mathematics and physics coincide with this restriction to Hilbert spaces.</span>  This is because Hilbert spaces generalize the notion of Euclidean space.  A Hilbert space possesses an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_product_space" target="_blank">inner product</a> and is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_metric_space" target="_blank">complete</a>; the former gives you the notions of angle and distance, the latter tells you that ther are "no points missing".<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>  These properties allow an extension of vector algebra and calculus to be made from two- and three-dimensional Euclidean space to a Hilbert space of any finite or even infinite dimension.  Hence Hilbert spaces allow generalizations of concepts like projections and change of basis from the usual finite-dimensional setting, with two specific examples of this being:
					<ul class="project-list">
						<li>The spectral theorem of compact linear operators on Hilbert spaces generalizes the invariant subspace decomposition of a square matrix that is in Jordan form via the invariant subspace decomposition of the operator.  If we also have that the operator is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_operator" target="_blank">normal</a>, then we will have that the operator is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonalizable_matrix#Diagonalization" target="_blank">unitarily diagonizable</a>.  In fact, the compactness requirement can be dropped in this case.</li>
						<li>The spectral theorem of compact self-adjoint linear operators on Hilbert spaces generalizes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigendecomposition_of_a_matrix" target="_blank">eigendecomposition of a matrix</a> via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_operator_on_Hilbert_space#Compact_self_adjoint_operator" target="_new">spectral decomposition of the compact self-adjoint operator</a>.  I.e., any compact self-adjoint linear operator on a Hilbert space can be unitarily diagonlized by an orthonormal set of eigenvectors, each of which correpsonds to a real eigenvalue.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<p>Given that Euclidean geometry seems to correctly describe the geometry of our universe at almost every scale, when attempting to extend finite-dimensional arguments about operators to an infinite-dimensional space, it makes sense to keep the arguments as close as possible to the familiar Euclidean geometric intuition.  Hence using the more general and potentially infinite-dimensional analogue of Euclidean geometry - Hilbert spaces - will yield useful generalizations and extensions of familiar Euclidean geometric, algebraic, and calculus arguments.  This obviously entails wide-ranging applications across many areas of mathematics and physics.

			<p>The application that I am most interested in is the role that operator theory and, more specifically, spectral theory play in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_formulation_of_quantum_mechanics" target="_blank">mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics</a>, as well as the spectral theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation" target="_blank">Schr&#246;dinger operators</a>.  In the realm of pure topics, I am very interested in a couple of open problems that I have come across in <a href="http://www.springer.com/us/book/9781441975140" target="_blank">Banach Space Theory: The Basis for Linear and Nonlinear Analysis</a> by Fabian, Habala, H&#225;jek, Montesinos, and Zizler; e.g., the following problem:
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>Assume that every subspace of a separable Banach space $X$ has an unconditional basis.  Is $X$ isomorphic to a Hilbert space?</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0px">
			Professor Kiselev, formerly at UW-Madison and now at Rice University, has written up a great overview of an area that I am very interested in, namely the spectral theory of Schr&#246;dinger operators, and posed a couple of extremely interesting open problems at the end.  I encourage you to check out the link below!</p>

					<p>A more specific description of such an attempted extension can be stated as: looking for infinite-dimensional classification analogies for classifying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonalizable_matrix" target="_blank">diagonalizable matrices</a>; exploring what properties are sufficient for an operator to have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_form" target="_blank">canonical decomposition</a> of the residing infinite-dimensional space, akin to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigendecomposition_of_a_matrix" target="_blank">eigendecomposition for square matrices</a> in a finite-dimensional vector space.  Relatively general operators on infinite-dimensional vector spaces are the main consideration here due to the "compact operator on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space" theory being very well-developed using direct extensions of matrix theory results to prove the corresponding operator-in-Hiilbert-space theorems; this is true even moreso if the operator is also self-adjoint.  A good example of this can be seen by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_operator_on_Hilbert_space#Compact_self_adjoint_operator" target="_blank">comparing the spectral theorem for a square Hermitian matrix to the spectral theorem for a compact self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space</a>.<a href="#fnref:2" title="return to article"></a>
