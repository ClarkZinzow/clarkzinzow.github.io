			<h2>Modified Nim Game Research</h2>
			<h4 class="margin">Mathematics Research</h4>
			<p>Nim is a two-player game in which each player takes turns removing one or more objects from one of potentially multiple heaps.  In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mis%C3%A8re" target="_blank">mis&#232;re</a> play, the person who takes the last object loses the game.  This can best be visualized by two players sitting in front of several piles of stones taking turns removing one or more stones from a single pile<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.  The player that takes the last stone from the last nonempty pile loses.  For more information on Nim games, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim" target="_blank">the wikipedia article is great!</a>

			<p>My research consists of a Nim game that is slightly modified.  In this modified Nim game, we have a pile of $N$ stones and two players.  Each player takes turns removing either percetage $A$ of the stones or percentage $B$ of the stones<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, and the player that takes the last stone loses.  I am currently investigating what happens when we: </p>
			<ul class="project-list">
				<li>Fix the percentages $A$ and $B$, and let $N$ vary.</li>
				<li>Fix $N$ large and let $A$ and $B$ vary.</li>
				<li>Let the number of stones, $N$, be a real number, remove the rounding requirements on the number of stones removed for each turn, and define losing as being the first person to yield a negative pile of stones.</li>
				<li>Add more potential moves for each player (percentages $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$, ...).</li>
				<li>Have more than one pile of stones to choose from.</li>
				<li>Determine what other, if any, combinatorial games these described games are equivalent to.</li>
				<li>A combination of the aforementioned, and more extensions that depend on the results of the above...</li>
			</ul>
